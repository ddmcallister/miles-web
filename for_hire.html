		<h3>Private Lessons</h3>
<p>Miles has taught all ages, ranging from fourth graders to retirees, and all skill levels from beginners to those preparing for college auditions.</p>  

<p>Skills covered include everything needed to play the trumpet successfully. Sound, projection, reading, technique, flexibility, repertoire, and range can all be developed if the student earnestly wants to take the time to develop them. A practice regimen is designed for each individual student depending on their strengths, weaknesses, and goals.</p>

<h3>Sectional Instruction</h3>

<p>Give your band students the advantage of a small group and focused learning environment.</p>  

<p>If your brass or trumpet section needs a quality instructor to guide them in anything from embouchure development to fine tuning for a competition or festival, his services are available.  He is an engaging teacher and can diagnose problems within a section that would otherwise fall through the cracks in a full ensemble setting.</p>  

<p>Miles has extensive experience teaching in both masterclass format and general music instruction at schools including Vista Murrieta High School, Fallbrook High School, Martin Luther King Jr. High School, William Workman High School, Rubidium High School, Raymond Cree Middle School, and Warm Springs Middle School.</p>
